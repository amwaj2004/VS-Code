                <p>
                    The Berlin Wall was erected on August 13, 1961, separating East and West Berlin during the Cold War.
                     It symbolized the divide between the communist East and the democratic West, preventing East Germans
                      from fleeing to the West. The wall stood for 28 years, leading to numerous attempts to escape and many 
                      tragic deaths. On November 9, 1989, widespread protests and political changes prompted its fall, marking 
                      a significant moment in history that paved the way for German reunification and the end of the Cold War.

                    Hurricane Milton struck Florida in early October 2024, reaching peak Category 5 strength 
                    with winds of 180 mph before downgrading slightly to Category 3 near Sarasota County. Despite 
                    weakening, the storm caused severe storm surges—up to 5 feet in areas like Naples—across Florida's 
                    Gulf Coast, resulting in heavy flooding, property damage, and dangerous conditions. The aftermath 
                    left many residents dealing with extensive repairs and cleanup efforts as emergency teams assessed 
                    and responded to widespread impacts throughout the region.

                <p>
                    As a computer science student interested in web and app development, I see the future of technology 
                    taking us toward more immersive and interconnected experiences. Advances in artificial intelligence 
                    and machine learning will enable more personalized applications, while the growth of smart technology will 
                    connect our devices in innovative ways. I also believe that web development will increasingly focus on accessibility 
                    and inclusivity, ensuring that technology is usable for everyone. Overall, I envision a future where technology 
                    enhances our daily lives, making them more efficient and enjoyable.
